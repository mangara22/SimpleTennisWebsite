    <p>Tennis is a sport where it can be played against one opponent or two opponents with a teammate. It involves playing with a ball and a racket on a court. The objective is to score in a way that your opponent can't return your shot. Tennis is played worldwide and can be played at almost any age, whether it would be professionally or recreationally.</p>

     <h2 id="Rules"><strong>The Rules of Tennis</strong></h2>
     	<p>The most important thing that people find hard to understand is the scoring. In Tennis, the score <em>starts at 0-0, where your score comes first</em>. Then, it goes 15, 30, 40, and if you and your opponent both have 40-40, it's called deuce. The next point after deuce is advantage, where you can either have the advantage <em>(ad in)</em>, or your opponent has the advantage <em>(ad out)</em>. Whoever wins the advantage or scores a point past 40 wins a game. Who ever gets to win 6 games wins the set, however, if you and opponent both get to 6-6 regarding sets, then you have to play a tiebreaker that scores by points from 1-7. In tennis, there is a <em>"win by two"</em> rule, where you have to have a difference of two to win, such as winning a set 7-5, or winning a tiebreak at 9-7, for example.</p>
        <p>Also in Tennis, there are linespeople that call the ball in and out when people serve or hit shots, players serve starting on the right side of the court <em>(deuce)</em>, and then alternate after every point <em>(ad, then deuce again)</em>. Players have two tries to get the ball into their opponents box that is opposite and diagonal from them. Sometimes, tennis matches use <em>Hawkeye Technology</em>, which if the ball lands close to a line that could either be an in or out call, they use certain camera technology to help players see where on the line the ball landed down to the millimeter, this usually is used in professional matches.</p>

     <h2 id="Equipment"><strong>Tennis Equipment</strong></h2>
     	<p>There are two main pieces of equipment in Tennis, <em>one is the racket, and the other is the ball</em>. There are many different racket brands, the most well-known is <em>Wilson, Babolat, and Head</em>. Rackets typically have different size grips and different size heads, or how big the hitting area is on the racket strings. Rackets can also have different weights and other customizations depending on the type of player. </p>
        <p>There are also many accessories too, such as a racket dampener that makes the ball feel <em>"muted"</em> when it hits the racket strings. There are also bags, wristbands, headbands, shoes, sports clothing, and other things that are made by different sports/tennis companies too.</p>

     <h2 id="History"><strong>The History of Tennis</strong></h2>
     	<p>Tennis originated as lawn tennis in England. <em>Walter Clopton Wingfield</em> would then begin experimenting with his version of ballplaying, it would then evolve to the <em>All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club</em>, where it would hold its first championship there. This Club would later to be known to hold the iconic/historic Grand Slam Tennis Tournament recognized today as <em>"Wimbledon"</em>.</p>

     <h2 id="ProTennis"><strong>Professional Tennis</strong></h2>
     	<p>In Tennis, <em>there are rankings, one for men (ATP, or Association of Tennis Professionals) and one for women (WTA, or the Women's Tennis Association created by Billie Jean King)</em> Each have a point system where the amount of points you have would determine your rank. You probably have heard of the popular professional names, such as <em>Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic</em>.</p>
<p>There are also many tournaments that happen during the year to help players gain points, the winners each get prize money and a certain amount of points depending on how far they got. <em>The biggest are the Grand Slam Tournaments, starting with the Australian Open, that happens in January with a hard blue court. The second is the French Open, that happens around June with a clay brown court. The third is Wimbledon, that has a grassy green surface. And the Fourth is the US Open, that has a blue and green hard court</em>. Each of these Grand Slam Tournaments has a lot of prize money, in the millions, and have more than 2000+ points to give to players if they win them.</p>
